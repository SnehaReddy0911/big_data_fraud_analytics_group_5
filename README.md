# 📊 Synthetic Financial Data Fraud Analysis

This project demonstrates end-to-end fraud detection analytics using synthetic financial transaction data in a PySpark environment. It focuses on exploring patterns, generating descriptive statistics, and identifying potential fraud signals using scalable data processing in Jupyter Notebooks.

🔍 Key Objectives
- Ingest and explore synthetic financial data
- Generate summary statistics and visualize trends
- Identify unusual or suspicious behavior using PySpark transformations
- Lay the foundation for building fraud detection models

⚙️ Technologies Used
- 🐍 Python 3.11
- 🔥 PySpark
- 📓 Jupyter Notebook
- 📁 CSV file format
- 💻 macOS (Local)

## 📁 Files Included

- `transactions_train.xlsx` — The original transaction dataset
- `fraud_detection_pipeline.py` — Big Data processing with PySpark (model training)
- `eda_fraud_analysis.py` — Visualizations & statistics in Python
- `README.md` — This setup and usage guide
